       # "name" is the name of the character who is speaking, it will appear in the name box at the top left of the chatbox, leave it empty to not have the name box shown.

       # "soundFilePath" is the relative sound file path to this file, a few examples are shown.

       # "affectionCheck" is a dictionary in this format {"NPC": XIAOMING, "comparison": SMALLER, "amount": 5, "altSceneIndex": 2 }. 
       # "NPC" is the NPC you want to check the affection level of.
       # "comparison" is to check whether it is smaller or bigger than the "amount".
       # "altSceneIndex" is the alternate scene you want to go to when the comparison returns TRUE.

       # "options" is a list that dictates what scenes the buttons go to.
       # If you have multiple options, create a list of dictionary
       # [{"text": "Scene 6", "nextSceneIndex": 6, "affection": {"affectedNPC": XIAOMING, "change": INCREASE}}, 
       #  {"text": "Scene 7", "nextSceneIndex": 7, "affection": {"affectedNPC": XIAOMING, "change": DECREASE}}] < like this
       # where "text" is the text shown in the option button, and "nextSceneIndex" is the scene's index in the array it will jump to when the button is pressed.
       # If you put options as a single number in a list e.g. [3], it will go to the scene at array index 3.
       # If you put options as [], an empty list, it will go to the scene in the next index.
       # "affection" is a dictionary that takes in the affected NPC and whether the button will INCREASE or DECREASE his affection.
       # If neutral, just put {"text": "Neutral Option Example", "nextSceneIndex": 8}, without "affection"
       # [{"text": "Positive Option Example", "nextSceneIndex": 6, "affection": {"affectedNPC": XIAOMING, "change": INCREASE}},
